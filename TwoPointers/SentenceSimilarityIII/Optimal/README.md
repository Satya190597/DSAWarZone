# Observation
The core observation in this problem is that two sentences are considered similar if one can be derived from the other by adding words to the beginning or end, while maintaining the original order of words. Specifically, this means:

#### Matching Prefix: 
The beginning of the shorter sentence should match the beginning of the longer sentence.
#### Matching Suffix: 
The end of the shorter sentence should match the end of the longer sentence.
To determine similarity, we only need to compare the words at the start and end of the two sentences rather than examining all possible combinations.

### Solution Approach
- Identify the Shorter and Longer Sentence:

- First, compare the lengths of the two sentences and assign the shorter sentence to **minimumArrayOfWords** and the longer one to **maximumArrayOfWords**.

- **Split the Sentences**: Split both sentences into arrays of words using space as the delimiter.


- **Check for Matching Prefix:** Initialize a pointer start at the beginning of the minimumArrayOfWords.
Iterate through the words of maximumArrayOfWords from the start, comparing each word with the current word of minimumArrayOfWords.
Increment the start pointer for every match found until a mismatch occurs or all words in minimumArrayOfWords are matched.

- **Check for Matching Suffix:** Initialize another pointer end at the last index of minimumArrayOfWords.
Iterate through the words of maximumArrayOfWords from the end, comparing with the current word of minimumArrayOfWords.
Decrement the end pointer for every match found until a mismatch occurs or all words in minimumArrayOfWords are matched.
Final Comparison:

- After checking both the prefix and suffix, check if the end pointer is less than the start pointer. This condition implies that all words from the shorter sentence have been accounted for in the longer sentence (either from the start or end), thus confirming the similarity.

### Time Complexity:
Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution can be analyzed as follows:

Splitting Sentences: The sentences are split into words using split(" "). This takes 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) time, where 
𝑛
n is the length of the longer sentence.

Checking Prefix: In the worst case, we may need to iterate through all words of the longer sentence, which takes 
𝑂
(
𝑚
)
O(m) time, where 
𝑚
m is the number of words in the longer sentence.

Checking Suffix: Similarly, checking the suffix may also take 
𝑂
(
𝑚
)
O(m) time.

Overall, the dominant operations involve iterating through the longer sentence twice (once for the prefix and once for the suffix). Therefore, the overall time complexity is:

𝑂
(
𝑛
+
𝑚
)
O(n+m)

Where 
𝑛
n is the length of the shorter sentence and 
𝑚
m is the length of the longer sentence. Since both lengths are bounded by the length of the input sentences, we can simplify this to 
𝑂
(
𝑘
)
O(k), where 
𝑘
k is the length of the longer sentence.

Space Complexity
The space complexity of the solution can be analyzed as follows:

Storage for Word Arrays: We create two arrays to hold the words from the two sentences. The space used for these arrays is proportional to the number of words in each sentence. If the total number of words across both sentences is 
𝑤
w, then this part uses 
𝑂
(
𝑤
)
O(w) space.

Other Variables: The additional space used for pointers and temporary variables is constant, 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1).

Overall, the dominant factor in space complexity comes from the arrays created to hold the words. Thus, the space complexity is:

𝑂
(
𝑤
)
O(w)

Where 
𝑤
w is the total number of words in both sentences.
