# Summary
The approach taken in the checkInclusion method is based on the sliding window technique combined with character frequency counting. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps involved:

### Initial Checks:
The method first checks the lengths of the two strings, s1 and s2. If s2 is shorter than s1, it immediately returns false because a permutation of s1 cannot fit within a smaller string.
### Character Frequency Count:
The method creates a frequency array (frequencyArrayOfS1) for s1. This array has 26 positions (one for each letter of the English alphabet) and counts how many times each character appears in s1.
Similarly, it creates a temporary frequency array (tempFrequencyArray) for the first sizeOfFirstString characters of s2.
### Initial Comparison:
The method checks if the frequency array for the first window in s2 matches the frequency array of s1 using the isMatch helper method. If they match, it means the first window is a permutation of s1, and it returns true.
### Sliding Window Technique:
If the initial window does not match, the method enters a loop to slide the window one character at a time across s2:
For each new position, it adjusts the tempFrequencyArray by:
Decreasing the count of the character that is leaving the window (the character at the beginning of the previous window).
Increasing the count of the character that is entering the window (the character at the end of the current window).
After adjusting the counts, it checks for a match again using the isMatch method.
### Return Result:
If any window matches, the method returns true. If the loop completes without finding a match, it returns false.
Complexity
### Time Complexity: 
The overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of s2. This is because each character in s2 is processed at most twice (once when entering the window and once when leaving). 
**Note comparison between two array will take constant time of 26.** 
### Space Complexity: 
The space complexity is O(1) because the frequency arrays are of fixed size (26).
Summary
This approach efficiently checks for permutations of s1 in s2 by leveraging character frequency counting and a sliding window to minimize unnecessary recalculations, making it both time-efficient and straightforward.
